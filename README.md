# Castle-Capture
A small game made in python with pygame. 4 players move about the board trying to own all 3 castles on the board. To capture a castle you must either land on the middle of it (the keep) or on one of it's outer squares. If you land on its outer square you must wait until your next turn to capture it. On your next turn you can press i to invade and conquer the castle. At the end of each go you must press enter to signify that your go is over. You can also take up a turn to destroy a piece of land. To do this simply press b and a bomb will appear on the screen. Move  this to where you want to destroy the land and press d then press enter to signify that your go is over. The first to own all 3 castles wins.
